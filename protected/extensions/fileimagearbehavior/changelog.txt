version 0.7
 - FileARBehavior and ImageARBehavior can be placed where you want (they just need to be in the same directory)
 - modification of Image extension
   - 3 new functions (emboss, negate, grayscale)
   - The ImageMagick Driver is optimized greatly by appending arguments for convert instead
     of reading / saving file for each function. The temp image copy in this driver is now useless
     and was removed too.
 - modification of FileARBehavior
   - can have formats, wich can be be processed (similar to old ImageARBehavior) but more generic: you can define your own processor class.
     - property moved from ImageARBehavior $formats
     -property added prcessor (set a yii import path to your own processor)
   - processing functions with no parameters (like grayscale and negate) can be set to true instead of array().
   - property added $forceExt to force saving files with a given extension.
   - property added $attributeSeparator to specify the separator used when mulitples primary keys. Default to '_'
   - getFilePath() now takes 1 optionnal argument, $format (default to 'normal')
   - getFilesPath() added, which returns an array of existing format => filePath
 - modification of ImageARBehavior
   - property added $useImageMagick to use ImageMagick instead of the default GD2 library.
   - the order of the processing functions is now important ! For example, use
     'process' => array('resize' => array(60, 90), 'grayscale' => true) instead of
     'process' => array('grayscale' => true, 'resize' => array(60, 90)) for better performance.
